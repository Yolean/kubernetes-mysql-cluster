# MySQL with automatic failover on Kubernetes

This is a galera cluster setup, with plain manifests.
We actually use it in production, though with modest loads.

## Get started

First create a storage class `mysql-data`. See exampels in `./configure/`.
You might also want to edit the volume size request, at the bottom of `./50mariadb.yml`.

Then: `kubectl apply -f .`.

### Cluster Health

Readiness and liveness probes will only assert client-level health of individual pods.
Watch logs for "sst" or "Quorum results", or run this quick check:
```
for i in 0 1 2; do kubectl -n analytics exec mariadb-$i -- mysql -e "SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size';" -N; done
```

Port 9104 exposes plaintext metris in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/) scrape format.
```
# with kubectl -n analytics port-forward mariadb-0 9104:9104
$ curl -s http://localhost:9104/metrics | grep ^mysql_global_status_wsrep_cluster_size
mysql_global_status_wsrep_cluster_size 3
```

A reasonable alert is on `mysql_global_status_wsrep_cluster_size` staying below the desired number of replicas.

### Cluster un-health

We need to assume a couple of things here. First and foremost:
Production clusters are configured so that the statefulset pods do not go down together.

 * Pods are properly spread across nodes.
 * Nodes are spread across multiple availability zones.

Let's also assume that there is monitoring.
Any `wsrep_cluster_size` issue (see above), or absence of `wsrep_cluster_size`
should lead to a human being paged.

Rarity combined with manual attention means that this statefulset can/should avoid
attempts at automatic [recovery](http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/pcrecovery.html).
The reason for that being: we can't test for failure modes properly,
as they depend on the Kubernetes setup.
Automation may appoint the wrong leader - losing writes -
or cause split-brain situations.

We can however support detection in the init script.

It's normal operations to scale down to two instances
- actually one instance, but nodes should be considered ephemeral so don't do that -
and up to any number of replicas.

### phpMyAdmin

Carefully consider the security implications before you create this. Note that it uses a non-official image.

```
kubectl apply -f myadmin/
```

PhpMyAdmin has a login page where you need a mysql user. To allow login (with full access) create a user with your choice of password:

```
kubectl -n analytics exec mariadb-0 -- mysql -e "CREATE USER 'phpmyadmin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'my-admin-pw'; GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'phpmyadmin'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;"
```
